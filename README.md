## This repo contains several Naive Bayes projects:
* [Fraud_Detection-NB](Fraud_Detection-NB.ipynb)- detecting credit card fraud cases using Naive Bayes algorithm   
* [Spam_Or_Ham](Spam_Or_Ham.ipynb)- detecting whether an email should be classified as ham or spam  
You can read more about Naive Bayes algorithms on my [blog]()
